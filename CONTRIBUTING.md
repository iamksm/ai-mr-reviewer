# Contributing Guidelines

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching under Issues.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with a clear list of the changes you want to see.

### Your First Code Contribution

- Look for open issues on GitLab, and comment on the issue to let people know you're interested in trying to fix it. This helps other people know that the issue is active, and hopefully prevents duplicated efforts.
- If you decided to fix an issue, start by **cloning the repository** and creating a new branch. Make your changes, and then ensure that they pass the project's tests and linters.
- Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.
- **Submit a merge request** against the `master` branch. Include a description of your changes.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Python Styleguide

All Python code must adhere to the [Google python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

### Testing

The project uses `pytest`. If you introduce new features into the project, make sure you add additional test cases and ensure all tests pass.
